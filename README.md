# webscrapping_hotpoint
The project I am creating is a web scraping application focused on extracting data from the Hotpoint Kenya website (https://hotpoint.co.ke/).
Web scraping is the process of automatically gathering information from websites by parsing and extracting data from their HTML structure.

The primary objective of this project is to collect specific information from the Hotpoint Kenya website, such as product details, prices, availability, customer reviews, and any other relevant data. By automating the data collection process, this project aims to provide an efficient and convenient way to gather and analyze information from the website.

The web scraping application will be developed using Python, which provides powerful libraries and frameworks for web scraping, such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy. These tools will enable the application to navigate through the website's pages, extract the desired data, and store it in a structured format, such as CSV or a database.
